# Fame

Fame is a game where you expand your influence on Twitter by strategically choosing your tweets from two positive sentiment and two negative sentiment tweets. Guess the tweet that will gain you the most followers and become Famous! The game was built during the Huggingface AI Game Jam. Theme of the jam was “Expanding”.

We used a Twitter corpus from NLTK, a celebrity tweet dataset from Kaggle, a multilingual embedding model from Huggingface sentence-transformers (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2) and an algorithm from sklearn to build a game that uses real data to update your score during game play. ChatGPT 3.5 also helped out!

Check out the Jupyter notebook for the algorithm that drives game mechanics and feel free to modify it:-)
